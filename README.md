# Tetremix

Tetremix is a web app that lets users play variants of the popular puzzle game Tetris. Not only that, all of those variants are created by other users. On the site, users can create their own Tetris game modes and explore game modes that others have created, viewing replays of previous Tetris games or trying the modes out themselves.
